This is woefully incomplete.

If you are using Fx, you need to use a WebSocket Flash emulator and thus you
will need to serve a Flash policy. A simple policy server is shipped in this
package, try:
$ sudo twistd -n flashpolicy

To start the server, try:
$ twistd -n vncap

By default, the daemon runs in WebSocket mode on TCP port 8888, bound to
localhost. It can be customized to target any endpoint; here are some
examples.

Running on TCP port 8000, bound to localhost:
$ twistd -n vncap -c tcp:8000:interface=localhost

Running on a local UNIX socket:
$ twistd -n vncap -c unix:/tmp/vncap.sock

Requirements:

 * If your distribution has a monolithic Twisted:

   * Twisted 10.x or newer

 * If your distribution has a modular Twisted:

   * Twisted Core 10.x or newer
   * Twisted Web 10.x or newer
